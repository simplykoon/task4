<p><img src = "funmi-kuti.jpg" alt = "This image cannot be viewed"></p>
<section>Born in Abeokuta, Nigeria, Ransome-Kuti was the first female student to attend the Abeokuta Grammar School. As a young adult, she worked as a teacher, organizing some of the first preschool classes in the country and arranging literacy classes for lower-class women.

<p>During the 1940s, Ransome-Kuti established the Abeokuta Women’s Union and fought for women’s rights, demanding better representation of women in local governing bodies and an end to unfair taxes on market women. Described by media as the "Lioness of Lisabi", she led marches and protests of up to 10,000 women, forcing the ruling Alake to temporarily abdicate in 1949. As Ransome-Kuti’s political reach expanded, she spearheaded the creation of the Nigerian Women’s Union and the Federation of Nigerian Women’s Societies, traveling nationally and internationally to advocate for Nigerian women’s right to vote.</p>

<p>Ransome-Kuti received the Lenin Peace Prize and was awarded membership in the Order of the Niger for her work. In her later years, she supported her sons in their criticism of military governments in Nigeria. She died aged 77 after receiving injuries from a military raid on family property. Ransome-Kuti's children included Fela Anikulapo Kuti, a musician and activist; Beko Ransome-Kuti, a doctor and activist; and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, a doctor and health minister.</p></section>
